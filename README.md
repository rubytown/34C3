# 34c3

The 34th Chaos Communication Congress from December 27th to 30th, 2017

Dear lovely Rubyists,

There will be a Ruby Town Assembly again! And we want you to join us for some amazing days on the congress in Leipzig <3

We will collect all relevant information here in this repo.

More Infos about the 33rd CCC: https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/Main_Page

## Follow us on Twitter
https://twitter.com/ruby_town

## Register for our Assembly at the Congress
https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/Assembly:Rubytown It's a bit tricky:

1. If you don't have a user yet create yourself one
1. Create a profile in the wiki by going to your user page https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/User:YOUR_USERNAME
1. Edit the page and add the folling information to it

```
{{User
|Speaks language=en - English, de - German
|Part of=rubytown
|Has mail contact=
|Has website=
|Lives in continent=Europe
|Lives in country=Germany
}}
```

After that to actually see yourself on the assembly page right away you have to hit the ["refresh" link](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php?title=Assembly:Rubytown&action=purge) on the assembly page.
